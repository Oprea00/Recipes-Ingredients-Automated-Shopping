# Recipes-Ingredients-Automated-Shopping

The purpose of this project is to research the domain of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) in order to develop an automated process that uses software robots that
replace human work.

The robot will identify if a picture represents a food recipe, extract and identify the ingredients by name and quantity
and classify the non-standard measurements (e.g.one spoon of...). When the list of ingredients is ready the robot will
order the ingredients from an online market and will send an email to the user with the order details.
